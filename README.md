.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));

Login: Go to the app's login page and use the admin credentials (username: admin, password: 1234) or register a new user.

Upload FAQs: Log in as an admin and use the admin panel to upload a .txt or .pdf file.

Start Chatting: Navigate to the chat interface and start interacting with the AI assistant!
